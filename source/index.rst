Welcome Python GIS Tutorials
==========================================
These tutorials provide an introduction to the use of Python in GIS. Topics covered by the different tutorials include loading data from different sources, thematic mapping, setting map projections, attribute and spatial queries, terrain mapping and analysis, geocoding, geoprocessing, spatial interpolation, spatial statistics, and web mapping.


Since Python has broad-based usages in GIS, some of the example scripts are from various Python spatial libraries. Other example scripts are for ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS API, QGIS. This approach is taken because the various mapping libraries provide different approaches to solving a problem and the scripts cannot be interchanged.  This approach is intended to give students a broad-based approach to working with Python in GIS.
