Setting up Development Environments
======================================

For these tutorials, we will run our Python scripts in different development environments depending on what needs to be accomplished. We will use the following development environments: the Standard Python Distribution, Anaconda Distribution, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS API for Python, and QGIS. This will give users an opportunity to familiarize themselves with these various platforms.
=======




Development Environments
==========================

For these tutorials, we will run Python in the following development environments: The Standard Python Distribution, Anaconda Distribution, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS APII for Python, and QGIS.

The Standard Python Distribution 
-----------------------------------

Many people use the Standard Python Distribution as their central platform for development. Scripts are executed in IDLE, which is Python's default integrated development environment.  After installation, you will notice that the Standard Python Distribution lacks many packages that are needed for GIS work so you will have to install these manually. Sometimes, installing these packages and their dependencies can be challenging, but these challenges are great opportunities for learning the inner details of Python.


1. To download the Standard Python Distribution, visit Python's `homepage <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_. Download the latest version.


2. If you are using a Windows computer, install the program on your computer using the Windows installer.
=======
The Python Core Distribution 
-----------------------------------------

Many people still use the core Python distribution to run their code. However, by default this distribution lacks many packages and their dependencies  that you will need for GIS so you will have to install them manually. 


1. To download the Python Core Distribution, visit Python's `homepage <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_. Download the latest version.


2. After downloading, install the program on your computer.

<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/build/html/_sources/getting_started.rst.txt
3. If you are using a mac computer, first download and install `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/)>`_ . Homebrew is a package manager that helps users to quickly install software packages on Mac computers using the command line.  Prior to installing homebrew, you need to install Xcode’s Command Line Tools. Xcode is a macOS integrated development environment (IDE). You can use it to make apps for all mac OSs, iOS, iPad OS, watch OS, and tv OS. To download and install it, run the following command in the Terminal:

    >>> xcode-select --install

4. Accept starting the installation and the license and it will be installed automatically.


5.  To install Homebrew automatically, run the command below:

    >>> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"


6. After installing Python on Windows or macOS check the version of Python that will be run from the command prompt. To do this type:

     >>> which python3

7. You should get  /usr/local/bin/python3 or something similar.


8. Check also that the Python 3x Directory has been added to your System's Path Environment Variable.  To check for this type, type:
    
    >>> $PATH


9. To install new packages, you need to use Pip.  The basic structure of the command is "pip install <package_name>". To install a library nameD *matplotlib*, type:

    >>> pip install matplotlib

   
10. To begin entering code into Python, start either the Python Interpreter or IDLE then enter the code.  

 .. image:: img/interpreter_idle.png
   :alt: Python Interpreter and IDLE


11. After installing Pyhton, you may realize that you have more than one Python installations on your computer. This is not an issue except that when you try to start Python from the command prompt, you may find that the Python installation you wish to start is not the recent one that you installed.  There are many ways to resolve this problem.  This `document <https://betterprogramming.pub/the-best-way-we-create-and-manage-multiple-versions-of-python-22363e065a43>`_ contains some tips on how to resolve this issue. You can google similar documents on the topic.
=======
3. Follow the `instructions <https://aaronstannard.com/how-to-setup-a-proper-python-environment-on-windows/>`_ on this page to do the following:

  a. Add the Python 2.7 Directory to your System Path Environment Variable. ...
  b. Install pip to Manage Your Python Packages. 
  c. Install virtualenv to Create Local Python Environments for Your Projects.

   
4. To begin entering code into Python, start the Python Interpreter or IDLE.  IDLE is an integrated development environment  that lets you create and edit Python scripts.

Python Virtual Environments
-----------------------------

When working with Python, it is a good idea to work with virtual environments. Virtual environments are isolated environments that Python developers can use to install and run packages for a specific project.  Thus, instead of installing the packages for the entire system, users can install the packages needed for a particular project. This allows each project to have its own dependencies regardless of what dependencies other projects may be using.   



**How to Install and Create Virtual Environment**


1. At the Python prompt, type

    >>> pip3 install virtualenv


2. Make a new directory to keep all your virtual environments in one place.

    >>> mkdir python-virtual-environments && cd python-virtual-environments


3. Create a new virtual environment inside the 'python-virtual-environments' directory.

   >>> python3 -m venv project_env


4. To activate the 'project_env virtual envirnonment' you created in the previous step, run the code below.  

   >>> source project_env/bin/activate


5. Notice how your prompt is now prefixed with the name of your environment (project_env, in our case). This indicates that 'project_env' is currently active, which means the python executable will only use this environment’s packages and settings.


6. To stop using the virtual environment, run the code below.

    >>> deactivate

Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda 
------------------------------

Anaconda is a large Python distribution that has become very popular over the last several years.  One reason for its popularity is that it comes  with many pre-installed packages. Also, users can run their code using Jupyter Notebook, which is a nice, browser-based environment for running code. I strongly recommend that you use Jupyter Notebook as much as you can for your Python GIS programming.


1. Download the Anaconda Distribution at `this site <https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>`_ (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). 


2. After intallation, start Anaconda, then launch the Jupyter Notebook.

The Python Console within QGIS
---------------------------------


**Running Python from the Console Shell**


<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/build/html/_sources/getting_started.rst.txt
1. Open QGIS.  From the main menu in QGIS, select Plugins | Python Console.  This will cause the Python Console to appear. It may open up towards the bottom of the application, however, if you wish, you can detach it from the main window and place it whereever you wish.


 .. image:: img/qgis_python_console1.png
   :alt: New Python Notebook


2. The lower part of the Console display with the >>> prompt. This is is where you type commands.  


3. The Python statements can be pure Python commands that have nothing to do with QGIS, or they can be Python statements ained at manipulating QGIS cser data i QGIS.


=======
1. Open QGIS and add this WFS layer. To do so, click on Add Layer | Add WFS Layer..., then select New and provide this URL: https://maps.gns.cri.nz/geology/wfs

2. Highlight the layer called NZL_GNS_250K_faults and select Add Layer to Project. 

.. image:: img/python_wfsLayer.png
   :alt: The NZL_GNS_250K_faults layer


3. From the main menu in QGIS, select Plugins | Python Console.  This will cause the Python Console to appear. It may open up towards the bottom of the application, however, if you wish, you can detach it from the main window and place it whereever you wish.


4. The lower part of the Console display with the >>> prompt. This is is where you type commands.  


5. The Python commands can be pure Python commands that have nothing to do with GIS or QGIS, or they can be Python commands ained at manipulating QGIS commands or user data.


6.  The iface class is used to access most graphical QGIS components. For example, to get a reference to the active layer, we can write:   

   >>> layer = iface.activeLayer()


7. Once you get a reference to the active layer object, you can access methods and properties associated with this object. For example, to get the name of the active layer, we write:
   
   >>> layer.sourceName()


8.  You should get the response in the upper half of the console

     'NZL_GNS_250K_faults'


9. Now, let us get a count of the number of features in the layer:

>>> layer.featureCount()

**Accessing the QGIS Python Editor**

<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/build/html/_sources/getting_started.rst.txt
1.  The editor is used to write scripts that are too lengthy to be edited and executed from the Console Shell.   It can be accessed by clicking "Show Editor" in the upper part of the console.



2.  To illustrate the use of the editor, we will execute a simple script to print the mean of a set of numbers. The script is provided below along with an illustration of how it appers in QGIS.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import numpy
   arr_mean = numpy.mean([31,35,46,59,71,80,84,82,75,62,48,36])
   print("The arithmetic mean is :", arr_mean)


.. image:: img/qgis_python_console2.png
   :alt: Python Script Print Name of Attribute Fields


=======
1.  The editor is used to write scripts that would be too lengthy to run from the Console Shell.   It can be accessed by right-clicking Show Editor in the upper part of the console.

2.  We will write a simple script to print the names of the fields in the attribute table of the WFC layer ::

      layer = iface.activeLayer()

      for fld in layer.fields():
          print(fld.name())


.. image:: img/python_script1.png
   :alt: Python Script Print Name of Attribute Fields


3. The script below get the length of each fault segment and maintains keeps a running total of the lengths ::

    layer = iface.activeLayer()
    lengths = []
    for fault in layer.getFeatures():
        lengths.append(fault.attribute("shape_len"))
        print(sum(lengths))
