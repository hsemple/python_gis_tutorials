Overview
=================

The tutorials on this website provide an introduction to the use of Python in GIS. They assume that users can operate GIS software from the menu and are seeking ways to work with the software using Python code.

Each tutorial is built around one or more exercises in which a GIS problem is tackled. Examples scripts are provided on how to solve the particular problem. Deliverables are based on problems similar to the ones solved by the example scripts.

Topics covered by the different tutorials include thematic mapping, loading data from different sources, map projections, attribute and spatial queries, terrain mapping and analysis, geocoding, digitizing, geoprocessing, spatial interpolation, spatial statistics, and web mapping. There is also a section on how to run Python scripts to automate processes.
