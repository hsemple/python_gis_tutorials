Accessing Python
--------------------

1. Anaconda is a large Python distribution that has become very popular over the last several years.  One reason for its popularity is that it comes with many libraries already pre-installed. Also, we can run our code using Jupyter Notebook.  I strongly recommend that you download the `Anaconda Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>`_. 
 
2. Some people  use the core Python software to run their code. However, by default this software lacks many libraries that you will need for GIS so you will have to install additional libraries. To download, visit Python's `homepage <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_. Download the latest version.

3. Python is preinstalled in ArcGIS Pro and QGIS, so you can use Python from within these environment to run your code.

Setting up your Python Working Environment
--------------------------------------------

Setting up your Python working environment depends on the Python distribution you are using. Below I provide information on a few approaches to this task.


 
**Anaconda/ Jupyter Notebook**

* Click on this `link <https://www.edlitera.com/en/blog/posts/guide-how-to-start-jupyter-notebook#mcetoc_1gcqvj0h63>`_ for information on how to open a Jupyter Notebook on Mac OS or Windows.

*  To create a new conda environment we can run:

           conda create --name arcgis4


*  If you need to install a new package, open the Anaconda folder in Windows, look for Anaconda prompt.  When the Anaconda prompt starts, enter the command below to search for an install a new package.

           conda install package_name
 

Conda installs many libraries with ease, however, installation of the arcpy library needs some special attention. The links below are workflows for installing arcpy in Anaconda.
  * `Set up Anaconda with ArcGIS  <https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/understanding-conda/>`_
  * `Anaconda Conda Jupyter Notebooks and ArcGIS Pro <https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/api-python/administration/python-api-core-concepts-part-2/>`_

**Configuring the Python Core Distribution**


After installing the core Python software, you will need to do the following:

a. Add the Python 2.7 Directory to your System Path Environment Variable. ...
b. Install pip to Manage Your Python Packages. 
c. Install virtualenv to Create Local Python Environments for Your Projects.

Click `here <https://aaronstannard.com/how-to-setup-a-proper-python-environment-on-windows/>`_ for more details.

*Writing, Saving and Running Python Programs with IDLE*

Python has a shell window called IDLE  which gives you access to the Python interactive mode. It also has a file editor that lets you create and edit existing Python source files. 
=======
The Python Standard Distribution 
-----------------------------------------

Many people use the standard Python distribution along with needed GIS packages and their dependencies to run their GIS code. This is an excellent environment for doing GIS, however, users will have to manually install almost all the required packages and their dependencies.  This task can sometimes be difficult for beginners. 


1. To download the Python Core Distribution, visit Python's `homepage <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_. Download the latest version.


2. After downloading, install the program on your computer.

 .. image:: img/install_python.png
   :alt: Install Python


3. Follow the `instructions <https://aaronstannard.com/how-to-setup-a-proper-python-environment-on-windows/>`_ on this page to do the following:

  a. Add the Python 3.x directory to your system path environment variable.   
  b. Install `pip  <https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows>`_ to manage your Python packages. 
  c. Install virtualenv to create local Python environments for your projects.

   
4. To begin entering code into Python, start the Python Interpreter or IDLE.  IDLE is an integrated development environment that lets you create and edit Python scripts.

**Using Jupyter Notebook that is already installed with ArcGIS Pro.**

If you have ArcGIS Pro installed on your computer, you can run Python using Jupyter Notebook that is installed with ArcGIS Pro. 


This tutorial shows how to run Python using Jupyter Notebook that is installed with ArcGIS Pro. This is a good option as the connection between Python and Jupyter Notebook has been already configured.   
=======
 
Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda 
-------------------------------

Anaconda is a large Python distribution that has become very popular over the last several years.  One reason for its popularity is that it comes with many packages already pre-installed. Also, users can run their code using Jupyter Notebook, which is a nice, browser-based environment for running code. I strongly recommend that you use Jupyter Notebook for your Python GIS programming.


1. Download the Anaconda Distribution at `this site <https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>`_. 


2. Start Anaconda, then launch the Jupyter Notebook. 


 .. image:: img/jupyter_notebook.png

   :alt: Install Python



4. If you need to install a new package, open the Anaconda folder in Windows then click on Anaconda prompt.  When the Anaconda prompt starts, enter the command below to search for an install a new package. Conda installs many packages with ease, so you should use it often.

           conda install package_name


5. Alternatively, you can install new packages from within Anaconda Navigator, as shown in the illustration below.

**Running Scripts from within ArcGIS Pro Using the Python Window**

In ArcGIS Pro, select the Analysis tab. Depending on your version of ArcGIS Pro, you will be able to select the Python Window. As shown below, in Python 2.7, you can click the drop-down menu to the right of the Python button and click Python Window. In other versions, or you may just have to click on the Python Window.
  

=======

Python Window in ArcGIS Pro 
-----------------------------
The Python window is a convenient environment for running the numerous geoprocessing tools that comes with ArcGIS. The environment is fully integrated with ArcGIS and saves the users the time needed to perform this configuration.



1. In ArcGIS Pro, select the Analysis tab. Depending on your version of ArcGIS Pro, you will be able to select the Python Window. As shown below, in ArcGIS Pro you can click the drop-down menu to the right of the Python button and click Python Window. In other versions, or you may just have to click on the Python Window.. This opens the Python window, as shown below.

This opens the Python window.
   

 .. image:: img/arcgis_python_window.png
   :alt: ArcGIS Python Notebook


The top section of the Python Window is called the transcript, and the bottom section is called the prompt. The transcript is initially blank. The transcript provides a record of previously entered code and its results.

The prompt is where you type your code. When the Python window first opens, the message in the prompt reads Initializing Python interpreter, which means the window is getting ready to receive your code. After a few seconds the message is replaced with Enter Python code here, which means you can start typing your code. After you have opened the Python window for the first time, these messages donâ€™t appear again in the current session.

ArcGIS API for Python
-----------------------

ArcGIS API for Python is a Python library for performing GIS visualization, analysis, and data management from within a Jupyter Notebook environment.  The ArcGIS API can be run from within ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise.  

The ArcGIS API for Python is distributed as a conda package named *arcgis*. It can be run from within Anaconda and other Python Distributions.  See this `hyperlink <https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/install-and-set-up/>`_ for more information.

The Python Console within QGIS
---------------------------------

Similar to ArcGIS Pro, Python can be run from within the QGIS software. Short codes can be run from a Console Shell while longer codes can be run from an editor.



**Running Python from the Console Shell**


1. From the main menu in QGIS, select Plugins | Python Console.  This will cause the Python Console to appear. It may open up towards the bottom of the application, however, if you wish, you can detach it from the main window and place it whereever you wish.

**Create an Anaconda environment that is compatible with ArcGIS Pro**


1. You can install the latest Anaconda for Windows via this link https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.11-Windows-x86_64.exe 

2. To avoid breaking ArcGIS (or other software), uncheck the checkboxes (a) make Anaconda the default Python and (b) add Anaconda's Python to the PATH. I will install Anaconda3 at C:/Anaconda3

3. You can follow step-by-step above in macOS Spatial Stack section on creating environment, activate and deactivate, install package via channel.
Workflow to set up Anaconda with ArcGIS Pro 2.7

    
4. Copy the folder arcgispro-py3 from C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\envs and paste to C:\Anaconda3\envs

5. Rename the copied folder arcgispro-py3 in C:\Anaconda3\envs to arcgispro

6. Test the virtual environment

     * At the Anaconda Command Prompt, type: conda activate arcgispro
     * Type: conda list. You can see the list of packages installed

7. Add more packages

     * Let's add the Python Spatial Analysis Library (pysal) module.
     * Type the following command at the Anaconda Prompt: conda install pysal

8. Configure ArcGIS to see Anaconda and vice versa

        Anaconda Python to ArcPy

            Edit the ArcGISPro.pth (path) file within "C:\Anaconda3\envs\arcgispro\lib\site-packages".

            Change the relative ArcPy path to C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Pro\Resources\ArcPy

            Change the relative ArcToolBox path to C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Pro\Resources\ArcToolBox\Script

        Arcpy to Anaconda Python

            Create a zconda.pth (path) file with the content "C:\Anaconda3\envs\arcgispro\lib\site-packages" in it.

            Then Copy zconda.pth to C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\envs\arcgispro-py3\lib\site-packages

        
        Testing in ArcGIS Pro

            Start ArcGIS Pro, open the Python window

            type "import pysal"

            type "pysal." A popup menu with a list of pysal-provided functions is a pretty good sign the install succeeded.

        Testing in PyCharm

            Start PyCharm, in File\Settingsâ€¦, choose Project then Project Interpreter

            Ignore the drop down list for Project Interpreter, and click the cog button to Add Local, and in the file browser pick C:\Anaconda3\envs\arcgispro\python.exe

            
            To run your script, right click it in the Project window, and choose either Run or Debug

            Restart PyCharm for the Python Console to use the arcpro environment.
