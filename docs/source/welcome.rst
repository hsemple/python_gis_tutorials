=================

The tutorials on this website provide an introduction to the use of Python in GIS. They assume that users can operate GIS software from the menu and are seeking ways to work with the software using Python code.


Topics covered by the different tutorials include setting up development environments, basic programming, thematic mapping, displahing data from different sources, map projections, attribute and spatial queries, terrain mapping and analysis, geocoding, digitizing, geoprocessing, spatial interpolation, spatial statistics, and web mapping. There is also a section on how to run Python scripts to automate processes.
