Welcome Python GIS Tutorials
==========================================
These tutorials provide an introduction to the use of Python in GIS. Topics covered by the different tutorials include loading data from different sources, thematic mapping, setting map projections, attribute and spatial queries, terrain mapping and analysis, geocoding, geoprocessing, spatial interpolation, spatial statistics, and web mapping.


Since Python has broad-based usages in GIS, some of the example scripts are generic Python scripts while others are for ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS API, QGIS and for various Python spatial libraries. This approach is taken because each environment different mapping library and the scripts cannot easily be transferred from one software package to another.  This approach is intended to give students a broad-based approach to working with Python in GIS.
